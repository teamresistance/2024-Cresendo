TODO: - More Check out.

Desc:
This handles several timers at the same time, so the same trigger can be used for 
different feedback.  On delay for start trigger and off delay for a stop delay (or 
on/off delay).
However, update should only called once.  So if you have 2 different calls only the 
first one should pass the trigger.  The second and others should call status only.

Sequence:
*  0 = delay on, wait delayTm before returning true.
*  1 = Off delay, once pressed wait delayTm before returning false.
*  2 = Delay on/off, delay on, AND delay off.
*  3 = Pulse, while triggered, on for delay then off for delay, repeat until no trigger.
*  4 = On Shot, when triggered returns on first pass, until next request.
